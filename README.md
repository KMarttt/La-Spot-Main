Download node & sql

Create the SQL database using the TableCreation2.sql

Then create the .env file in the BackEnd based on the env-example (or the one I sent in the DC )

Create two terminals (for BackEnd and FrontEnd)

On the first terminal:

- cd BackEnd
- npm install
- npm start

On the second terminal:

- cd frontEnd
- npm install
- npm run dev
- Then follow the link

Note: Use the Admin Code from the database to create your very own admin account
